1.HUPA0001-carb_input - amount of carbohydrates consumed in grams

  0 should be replaced as N/A
So a 0 likely means "data not recorded", and should be treated as missing. These can’t be 0 for a living person.
Ranges found here are from 0-4

2.HUPA0001-basal_rate - continuous insulin delivery date (Units/hour)
Patient Type	Typical Basal Rate (U/hr)
Adults (T1D or T2D)	0.1 – 2.0
Pediatric patients	0.05 – 1.0
Athletes / insulin sensitive	<0.5
⚠️ Values That Suggest Errors (Outliers)
Value (U/hr)	Interpretation	Action
0	Possible missing data or off pump	Replace with NaN unless justified
< 0.05	Too low for meaningful delivery	Treat as missing or incorrect
> 5	Highly unlikely (clinical outlier)	Flag or remove
> 10	Likely data entry error	Remove or review

   0 values can be Possible missing data or off pump Replace with NaN unless justified
    When there are values less than 0.05 (not including 0) considered as incorrect/missing data
    Range present here  is from 0 to 0.91
    Round of values by 2 digits
          

3.HUPA0001–time. 
Convert the time column and remove T for better readability using pd.to_datetime()

4.HUPA0001-glucose.
        Values like 217.2608696 can be rounded to 217.26  
         Values below 40 and above 500 should be considered as outliers. But here there are outliers
         No negative values. No 0 values.
        Values are from 40-444

5.HUPA0001-calories – Calories burnt via smart watch

        No negative values. No 0 values.
        Values can be rounded of by 2 decimal points.
         No outliers found b/w 4.02-37.5

HUPA0025 Range from 7 to 106 which is different from others.

6. HUPA0001-Heart rate - beats per minute
	((Normal adult: 60–100 BPM Athletes: 40–60 BPM (can be lower) Tachycardia: >100 BPM
Bradycardia: <60 BPM) Sinus tachycardia100–150 BPM	Normal rhythm but fast
Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) 150–250 BPM Often episodic
Ventricular tachycardia	100–250 BPM	Can be life-threatening
Atrial fibrillation (rapid)	110–180 BPM	Irregular rhythm)

	Values can be rounded by 2 digits
	No values found under 40
             Highest 167.32 (can 100 be considered outlier?)

HUPA0005 - Heart rate is present <40 which is outlier




7.HUPA0001- steps - number of steps track via variable device
	Range found here are from 0-621

8. HUPA0001- bolus_volume_delivered-Insulin dose administered in units
          This is short-acting insulin given before meals or to correct high glucose.
	Outliers	<0.5 or >100	Often data entry or device error

           Ranges present here are from 0 to 19.8
           No negative values found
           Outliers found less than 0.5
